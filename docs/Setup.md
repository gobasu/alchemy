Setup
=====

Server requirements
-------------------

- PHP 5.3.x or newer.
- Curl extension on
- PDO with MySQL (to make DB working)

Basics
------

In the repository there are two folders one of them is named `app` and this is example structure
for your application code.
Dir structure looks like this:
- `cache`
- `controller`
- `model`
- `view`
- `plugins` (not required)
- `public` (server's root directory have to point at this one)

Of course you can use totally different structure but you should follow some conventions:
- Dirnames must be lower case
- Every file containing class which should be loaded dynamically must have the same name as the class.
- The namespace of given class must corresponds to the dirname.

Assume we willing to create `HelloWorld` class which will be one of controllers for our application, we should
end with path similar to: `/myapp/mycontroller/HelloWorld.php`, and therefore file must containing contents
similar to below ones

```php
<?php
namespace myapp\mycontroller;
class HelloWorld extends \alchemy\app\Controller
{
  //here goes your methods and properties
}
```

The other one is a framework package (the `alchemy` dir)- it holds all classes that simplify your work.
Framework has been sharded into packages, every package has its own role in framework;

- `app` FW's core classes which setup all application and controlls flow
- `event` event package wich uses Observer pattern to make framework elastic
- `file` file manipullation classes (images, xls, etc... goes here)
- `http` classes connected with http protocol and request handling
- `object`
- `security` acl and validation class
- `storage` package which focuses on persisting data
- `ui` views and views helpers
- `vendor` vendor classes and external API helpers (paypal, payu, ups, facebook, g+, etc...)

Creating bootstrap file
-----------------------

In order to create your first application point you server's root directory to `public` dir and put there an `index.php` file

```php
<?php
require_once $VALID_PATH_TO . '/alchemy/app/Application.php';
use alchemy\app\Application;

$app = new Application($PATH_TO_APPLICATION_ROOT);

//add routes here...
$app->addRoute('*', function(){
  echo 'Hello World!';
});

//run application
$app->run();
```

`$PATH_TO_APPLICATION_ROOT` must be valid dirname pointing to the application root directory (the one that holds whole app's
direcotry structure)


Now if you go to `http://localhost/` url you should see:

    Hello World
